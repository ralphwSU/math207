\medskip

1. (10 points)  A program is being tested on an extremely expensive computer.  
Due to costs, the program is only run twice.  The output values are $4$ and $8$.
If the  program is running correctly, its average output value is $4$.
Is the program running correctly?  State the statistical test that you use and
compute the test statistic.  Estimate the $P$-value and discuss its significance.
