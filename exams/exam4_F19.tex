1. (25 points) A survey is conducted of 100 freshmen at public universities.
It is found that these students work 11.5 hours a week for pay, 
on average.  The SD of the data is 5.  

\hspace{20pt} a) Find a 95\% confidence interval
on the  hours  a week worked by freshmen at public universities.
\vspace{2.5in}

\hspace{20pt} b) True or false and explain:  There is a 95\% chance that
if a second sample of 100 freshmen were taken
the average of the sample would be in the range you found in a).
\vspace{1.5in}

\hspace{20pt} c) True or false and explain:  There is a 95\% chance that the
average hours a week worked for pay among \textit{all} freshmen at public universities
is in the range you found in a).
\vspace{1.5in}

\hspace{20pt} d) True or false and explain:  There is a 95\% chance that the
average hours a week worked for pay among all 18--20 year olds
is in the range you found in a).

2.  (15 points) Based on the survey data in \#1, a news organization reports that the
freshmen at public universities work~12 hours a week for pay, on average.
Use a $z$-test to comment on this assertion.
State the null and alternative hypotheses. Calculate the test statistic and 
estimate the $P$ value.

Would taking the average of 100 measurements decrease
the likely size of the chance error by a factor of 5, 10 or 25? Justify your answer.

4. (10 points) A surveyor is measuring the distances between five points $V$, $W$, $X$,
$Y$, and $Z$ along a straight line.  She finds that each of the four distances measures one 
mile, give or take two inches or so.  The distance from $V$ to $Z$ is about four miles; 
but the estimate is likely to be off by around:  
4~inches, 2~inches, 1~inch, 1/2~inch or 1/4~inch. Justify your answer.\vspace{-5pt}
