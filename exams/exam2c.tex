2. (10 points) For women age 25 and over in the U.S. in 2005, the relationship between
age and educational level (years of schooling completed) can be summarized as
follows.

\hspace{20pt} a) True or false:  For women age 25 and older in the U.S. in 2005, older women tended 
to be less\vspace{-5pt}

4. (10 points) Test scores on a certain exam average out to 75 with a standard 
deviation of 3.  One student scored 84.   Was that a very high score?  Moderately high?

\hspace{20pt} b ) The correlation between gasoline economy and income of owner turns out to 
be positive?  How do you account for this association?

is \[y=\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\,\left(\frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\,(x-1)\]
