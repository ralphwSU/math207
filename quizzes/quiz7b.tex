\textbf{\large  Quiz 7}
\end{center}

1. With a perfectly balanced roulette wheel, in the long run, 
red numbers should turn up 18 times in 38.
To test its wheel, one casino records the results of 3,800 plays, finding 1,890 red
numbers.  Is that too many reds?  Or chance variation?

\hspace{20pt} a) Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses as 
statements about a box model.
\vspace{1.5in}

\hspace{20pt} b) The null says that the percentage of reds in the box is
\underline{\hspace{30pt}}.  The alternative says that the\vspace{-4pt}

\HH percentage of reds in the box is 
\underline{\hspace{30pt}}.
\bigskip
\bigskip


\hspace{20pt} c) True or false and explain:
If the $z$ score for the test is $2.9$ and the $P$-value is $0.2$\%
then there is\vspace{-4pt}

\HH only a $0.2$\% chance that the null hypothesis is true.
\vspace{.5in}

2. A news agency conducts a political poll of 400 registered voters and finds that
  2/3 favor the Workers' Party candidate.  

\hspace{20pt} a) Find a 95\% confidence interval on 
  the percentage of all registered voters who favor that candidate.\vspace{-4pt}

\HH (Hint $\sqrt{(2/3)\,(1/3)}\approx 0.47$.)
\vspace{2in}

\hspace{20pt} b) In the election, it turns out that the Workers' Party candidate loses.
Give two possible explanations.

3. One kind of plant has only blue flowers and white flowers.  According to a 
genetic model, the offsprings of a certain cross have a 75\% chance
to be blue-flowering.  One hundred seeds of such a cross are raised, and
71 turn out to be blue-flowering.  Are the data consistent with the model?  
Answer yes or no,  explain briefly and justify your 
answer. (Hint:  $\sqrt{(1/4)*(3/4)} \approx 0.4$.)
