1. Three cards are dealt from a well-shuffled deck.
\smallskip

\hspace{20pt} a) Find the chance that all the cards are diamonds.
\vspace{0.75in}

\hspace{20pt} b) Find the chance that none of the cards are diamonds.
\vspace{0.75in}

\hspace{20pt} c) Find the chance that the cards are not all diamonds.
\vspace{0.75in}

\hspace{20pt} d) Find the chance that the third card is a 10.
\vspace{0.75in}

\hspace{20pt} e) Find the chance that the third card is a 10 given that the first two 
were $J\clubsuit$ and $2\heartsuit$.
\vspace{0.75in}

\hspace{20pt} f) Find the chance that the second card is a three or a $\spadesuit$.
\vspace{0.75in}

\hspace{20pt} g) Let $A$ be the event that the first card is a $\clubsuit$. 
Describe an event $B$ for which $A$ and $B$ are\vspace{-3pt}

\hspace{20pt} \hphantom{g) } independent.
\vspace{1in}

\hspace{20pt} h) Let $A$ be the event that the first card is a $\clubsuit$.

Find the chance that:
\smallskip

\hspace{20pt} a) The number drawn from (A) is larger than the one from (B).
\vspace{1in}

\hspace{20pt} b) The number drawn from (A) equals the one from (B).
\vspace{1in}

\hspace{20pt} c) The number drawn from (A) is smaller than the one from (B).
\vspace{1in}

\newcommand{\ticket}[2]{\psframe(0,0)(0.5,0.5)\psframe(0.5,0)(1,0.5)\rput(0.25,0.25){#1}\rput(0.75,0.25){#2}}
3. In the box shown below, each ticket should have two numbers:
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(15,0.5)
\rput(0,0){\ticket{1}{}}
\rput(2,0){\ticket{1}{2}}
\rput(4,0){\ticket{1}{2}}

\rput(8,0){\ticket{3}{1}}
\rput(10,0){\ticket{3}{2}}
\rput(12,0){\ticket{3}{}}
\rput(14,0){\ticket{3}{}}
\psline(-0.2,0.6)(-0.2,-0.2)(15.2,-0.2)(15.2,0.6)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

A ticket will be drawn at random.  Can you fill in the blanks so that 
the two numbers are independent?
\vspace{1in}

4. A box has 9 green beads and one red bead.  Three beads are drawn at random with replacement.
Find the probability that a two red beads will be drawn.
